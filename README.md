# Web Scraping Workshop
The GitHub repository features the source codes for the colab notebooks that were presented and taught during the "Data Scraping Workshop" conducted by GDSC - PUP Manila. The source codes are inside the `src` folder:

- `scraping-github-profiles`

Contains two Jupyter notebooks (`github_profiles_bs4.ipynb` and `github_profiles_selectolax.ipynb`) that demonstrate how to scrape Github profiles using Beautiful Soup and Selectolax, respectively.

- `scraping-quotestoscrape`: 

Contains two Jupyter notebooks (`quotestoscrape_bs4.ipynb` and `quotestoscrape_selectolax.ipynb`) that demonstrate how to scrape the "Quotes to Scrape" website using Beautiful Soup and Selectolax, respectively.

## Dependencies
